== Purpose ==
This is a screen scraper for the FFXIV community side, Lodestone. It gets information about
characters.

== Usage ==
Take, for example, this character: <http://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=1015990>

To fire it up, call Character.new with the cicuid from that URL:

  require 'ffxiv_lodestone'
  char = FFXIVLodestone::Character.new(1015990)

Stuff you can do:

  char.skills => SkillList with these methods:
    .list => Array of all skills that have been leveled (ie rank 0 jobs omitted)
    .pugilist (or any class name) => The skill, regardless of if its been leveled or not
              (ie you can explicitly ask for a skill to see if it's been leveled or not)

  chat.resistances => StatList (same deal as stats but with fire instead of strength, 
                      see method list below)
  char.stats => StatList with these methods:
    .each {} => Does some iteration
    .strength (or any stat name) => Integer value of the state

A skill object has these methods: 
  name, skill_name, rank, skillpoint_to_next_level, current_skill_points

== TODO ==
* Error handling (if you put in a crap char ID you'll get some cryptic Nokogiri errors)
* Figure out what the fuck the stats in parenthesis mean and do something with them.
  * Currently, these are dropped on the floor because I don't know what they mean. The current
    theories include 'Base (with gear)' and 'Stat (with buffs)'.
