== Purpose ==
This is a screen scraper for the FFXIV community side, Lodestone. It gets information about
characters.

== Usage ==
Take, for example, this character: <http://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=1015990>

To fire it up, call Character.new with the cicuid from that URL:

  require 'ffxiv_lodestone'
  char = FFXIVLodestone::Character.new(1015990)

Stuff you can do:

  char.skills.list => Array of all skills that have been leveled (ie rank 0 jobs omitted)
  char.skills.pugilist (or any class name) => The skill, regardless of if its been leveled or not
                        (ie you can explicitly ask for a skill to see if it's been leveled or not)

A skill object has these methods: 
  name, skill_name, rank, skillpoint_to_next_level, current_skill_points
