== About ==
This is a screen scraper for the FFXIV community side, Lodestone. It gets information about
characters. The Lodestone pages are a huge pile of shit, so this will save you a few hours of
hating your life while you write a screen scraper.

The aim is to not break if SquareEnix adds new pieces of data to the page. Any new attributes,
skills, of general pieces of profile data should automatically be handled by this library.

She ain't pretty, but it's decently robust. 

== Usage ==
Take, for example, this character: <http://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=1502635>

To fire it up, call Character.new with the cicuid from that URL:

  require 'ffxiv_lodestone'
  char = FFXIVLodestone::Character.new(1502635)

Stuff you can do:

  char.to_json => String containing a JSON representation of the character / jobs.

  char.name, char.world, char.nameday, char.guardian, char.starting_city, char.physical_level,
  char.current_exp, char.exp_to_next_level, char.gender, char.race, char.clan

  char.skills => SkillList with these methods:
    .list => Array of all skills that have been leveled (ie rank 0 jobs omitted)
    .pugilist (or any class name) => The skill, regardless of if its been leveled or not
              (ie you can explicitly ask for a skill to see if it's been leveled or not)

  char.resistances => StatList (same deal as stats but with fire instead of strength, 
                      see method list below)
  char.stats => StatList with these methods:
    .each {} => Does some iteration
    .strength (or any stat name) => Integer value of the state

A skill object has these methods: 
  name, skill_name, rank, skillpoint_to_next_level, current_skill_points

== FAQ ==
Q. Hey, why doesn't this have HP / MP / TP? They're on the character profile page!
A. Because those values change based on the currently equipped job. I don't think they're useful
   pieces of data. If you have a use case for them, please let me know and I will include them.

If you want to fool around with the source code, you can see if you've fucked everything up:

  ffxiv-lodestone$ gem install bacon
  ffxiv-lodestone$ cd test/
  ffxiv-lodestone$ bacon spec.rb

== TODO ==
* Figure out what the fuck the stats in parenthesis mean and do something with them.
  * Currently, these are dropped on the floor because I don't know what they mean. The current
    theories include 'Base (with gear)' and 'Stat (with buffs)'.
* Make SkillList implement enumerable.
* Character search by name in the constructor. Pending Lodestone's character search not randomly
  omitting people.
* RDoc shit.
