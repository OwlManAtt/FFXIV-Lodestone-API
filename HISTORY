== 0.9.5 ==
* :world is no longer a required argument when loading by name and searching.
* User agent is now 'ffxiv-lodestone-VER (Ruby/RUBY-VER)'.

== 0.9.4 ==
* Can load non-Gridanian characters now. I guess I'd never tested against a character that
  started in Limsa or Uld - there's an ID that's different between the three so the top box can
  be different colours. 

  I am literally the worst developer ever and I apologize most profusely to everyone because holy
  shit that's kind of a massive bug.

== 0.9.3 ==
* Character.search() will now return up to 40 results; previously, it was only 20.

* Character#skills now has an alias - #jobs. Sementically, char.jobs.carpenter makes more sense
  than char.skills.carpenter - the skill name is carpentry.

  They return exactly the same data, but #skills should be considered deprecated. I may replace it
  with something else in the future.

* When specifying :world in Character.search() and Character.new(), you can pass the server's ID
  number instead of the server's name. You should only use the ID if new servers are opened and
  the gem has not been updated with the name => ID mapping yet.

* strip_nbsp and strip_nbsp! are added to String to handle Nokogiri's oddness more cleanly. I hope
  this doesn't fuck up your application.

== 0.9.2 ==
* Added Character.search() method. It wraps the character search page; an array of hashes will
  be returned with the resulting characters. 
* The full-size portrait URL and thumbnail portrait URLs are now scraped in.

== 0.9.1 ==
* Rails compatability! The #to_json() methods now take an argument (which is promptly dropped on
  the floor) to make ActiveSupport happy.

== 0.9.0 ==
* SkillList#list() changed to SkillList#levelled().
* Characters can be searched and loaded by name. See the README for directions on how to do this.
* Refactored, many things now extend hash.
